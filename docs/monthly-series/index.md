## Smart Sorting System

Our automation system uses **intelligent sorting** that prioritizes:
1. **Episode Numbers** (Episodes 1, 2, 3, etc.)
2. **Series Logic** (S1, S3, S4, etc.)
3. **Upload Dates** (as tiebreakers)

This ensures episodes appear in the intended learning order, not just chronological upload order.
